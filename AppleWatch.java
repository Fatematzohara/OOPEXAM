 *\t An abstract class is a superclass

*\n Contains both abstract and non abstract methods.
*\n Abstract method can not be implemented, can be defined (declared) only
*\n Non abstract methods can be implemented, but can not be defined (declared).
*\n Variable can be declared or initialized inside an abstract class
*\n It is mandatory to put abstract keyword with the abstract method inside abstract class
*\n This is the norm to write at least one abstract method inside abstract class
*\n We can declare a constructor inside abstarct class
